# US-Quiz
This is a quiz game that tests your knowledge of the 50 states of the United States. The game uses Python and Tkinter to create a graphical user interface that displays a map of the United States. When you correctly identify a state, its name is added to the map. The game continues until all 50 states have been identified.
